# R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT

This repo contains the analyses performed for the paper:

Al-Tamimi, J. and Khattab, G., (2018). *Acoustic correlates of the voicing contrast in Lebanese Arabic singleton and geminate plosives*. Invited manuscript for the special issue of Journal of Phonetics, "Marking 50 Years of Research on Voice Onset Time and the Voicing Contrast in the Worldâ€™s Languages" (eds., T. Cho, G. Docherty & D. Whalen). In press. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.09.010

Two types of analyses were performed:

1. Linear Mixed Effects Modelling as a confirmatory analyses [see notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/Voicing%20and%20Gemination%20-%20Mixed%20Effects%20Modelling.nb.html)
2. Random Forests by Conditional Inference Trees as a classification technique [see notebook](https://jalalal-tamimi.github.io/R-Voicing-Gemination-VOT/Voicing%20and%20Gemination%20-%20Random%20Forests.nb.html)

The datasets can be accessed here:
